Here is **Tianyu Feng (Tim, å†¯å¤©æ˜±)**.

I am a second year master student majoring in **Computer Science** at [HiPO Group](https://github.com/buaa-hipo) in Beihang University (BUAA; formerly as Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics), advised by [Prof. Hailong Yang](https://thomas-yang.github.io/). 

I would always be happy to collaborate! Email me at - *tian[dot]yu[dot]feng[at]outlook[dot]com*

## Research Interests

- **High Performance Computing:** including sparse computing, scientific computing application optimization and stencil.
- **Machine Learning Systems (MLSys):** including training, inference and model serving systems.
- **Parallel Computing:** including CPU, GPU and other many-core processors.
- **Performance Analysis Tools:** large-scale performance analysis of programs running among up to thousands of nodes.

My research interests mainly cover traditional high performance computing and machine learning systems. Currently, I'm focusing on optimizing machine learning systems from multiple perspective including kernels, data placement and scheduling. I'm also working on exploiting sparsity in various computing workloads including AI and HPC on many-core and heterogeneous systems. The ultimate goal is to shorten computing time of solving significant real world problems.
