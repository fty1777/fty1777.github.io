Here is **Tianyu Feng (Tim, 冯天昱)**.

I am a Year 1 PhD student in **Computer Science and Engineering** at HKUST, advised by [Prof. Wei WANG](https://home.cse.ust.hk/~weiwa/).

Formerly I got my master's in **Computer Science and Technology** in [HiPO Group](https://github.com/buaa-hipo) at Beihang University, advised by [Prof. Hailong Yang](https://thomas-yang.github.io/). 

I would always be happy to collaborate! Email me at - *tian[dot]yu[dot]feng[at]outlook[dot]com*

## Research Interests

- **Machine Learning Systems (MLSys):** including training, inference and model serving systems.
- **Generative AI (GenAI/AIGC):** system optimization for GenAI workloads including text2image/text2video/image2video tasks characterized by diffusion models.
- **Sparse Computing:** including sparse kernel optimization and sparsity excavation.

My research interests mainly cover machine learning systems. Currently, I'm focusing on optimizing machine learning systems, especially diffusion-based image/video foundation model training and generation systems, from multiple perspective including kernels, data placement and scheduling. I'm also working on exploiting sparsity in various computing workloads including AI and HPC on many-core and heterogeneous systems. The ultimate goal is to shorten computing time of solving significant real world problems.
